COLLEGE MNAGEMENT SYSTEM

1.*Student* -->like checking attendance ,seeing results ,editing our profile but students can only read operation only

2.*Admin*-->Teachers can give marks , they can see any students like each and every students attendence or marks , and they can Give some instruction like circular so on..
But the admin can do anything like insert , delete. Because Administration can do anything
